                        <p>
                            The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is an iconic symbol of India's rich cultural heritage.
                            Built in the 17th century by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this 
                            magnificent white marble mausoleum is renowned for its breathtaking architectural beauty and intricate 
                            craftsmanship. The Taj Mahal's symmetrical design, with its stunning domed central structure 
                            and four elegant minarets, stands as a testament to Mughal architecture's brilliance. 
                            Visitors from around the world flock to Agra to marvel at the Taj Mahal's ethereal beauty,
                            which seems to change its hue with the shifting sunlight throughout the day. 
                            This enduring symbol of love continues to capture the hearts of millions, making it one of the 
                            most recognized and cherished landmarks on the planet.
                            The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.<br>

                            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.<br>
                            The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical "drum" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome).[24] The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical. Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.<br>

                            The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements.[27] The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.<br>

                            The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets – a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.<br>

                            <h1>Exterior decorations</h1>

                            The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. Throughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.

                            The calligraphy on the Great Gate reads "O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you."[31] The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of "Amanat Khan" upon him as a reward for his "dazzling virtuosity".[32] Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, "Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi".[33] Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble[32] inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.[citation needed] <br>

                            Abstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex[citation needed] array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.<br>

                            On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.<br>

              <p>
                            Kerala, often referred to as "God's Own Country," is a paradise of natural beauty. Its backwaters,
                            such as Alleppey and Kumarakom, are a serene network of canals fringed with lush greenery. The misty hills 
                            of Munnar offer breathtaking tea plantations and stunning vistas. The pristine beaches of Kovalam and 
                            Varkala are perfect for relaxation and sunsets. Exploring the dense forests of Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary 
                            completes the tapestry of Kerala's stunning landscapes. <br>

                            <h1 class="card-heading">History</h1>
                            There are various legends about the state. The most popular legend is that Kerala was raised from the depths of the ocean. Several Hindu rulers ruled the state like Venad (in the Travancore area), the Cheras rulers, the Zamorine etc. Vasco De Gama landed in this state at Kozhikode (Calicut) in 1498 A.D. in the reign of Zamorin dynasty. The Arabs also played a useful role in transmitting the culture of this state. The Muslim ruler of Mysore, Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan had their sway over Kerala till the British arrived.The British took northern Kerala under their direct rule and thereby came the Malabar area under the British with Calicut as the principal city. The southern part of this state, Cochin (now Kochi) and further south the state of Travancore were granted separate existence by the British. After independence first, two major princely states of Kerala, Cochin and Travancore, were merged into a single state and in 1956 when the states of India were recognised on a large scale, the state of Kerala was created with separation of Malabar region from Madras and its merger with the Travancore-Cochin combined state. It is believed that the name Kerala is derived from Ker, the Coconut tree, although some scholars hold a different view.<hr>

                          <h1 class="card-heading">Geography</h1>
                          Kerala is one of the small states of India in terms of area. it consists of only 1.3 per cent of the total area of India. The state is located in the southwest corner of India. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu bound it on north, east and south and on east by the Arabian Sea. Physiographically, the state may be divided into three regions, Highlands, Midlands and Lowlands. In between the high western ghats and the Arabian sea, the width of the State varies from 35 km to 120 km. There are extensive backwaters, lagoons, and coconut trees in the lowland area. The midland area are watered by numerous streams and where the presence of rice-fields, arecanut and coconut trees continues to dominate the landscape. The third natural part, the highlands of western ghats consists deep ravines and thick jungles. Thus Kerala is a narrow stretch of green land. The state is a land of rivers and backwaters. As many as 41 rivers which rise from the western ghats, flow down to the midlands and lowlands to the west. There are a few east flowing rivers also, which are the tributaries of the Cauvery. The length of most of the rivers is extremely limited and they are monsoon-fed. Some of the rivers are Bharatapuzha, Chalakkudy, Peechi, Malampuzha, Gayatri, Walayar, Vazhani, Neyyar, Periyar, Mangalam and Cheerakuzhy.The backwaters form a specially attractive and economically valuable feature of Kerala. They include lakes and ocean inlets which stretch irregularly along the coast. The biggest backwater is the Veembandh lake. The state has a long coastline is about 550 km long. The state enjoys an equable climate with high temperatures almost throughout the year. There is participation of both monsoon southwest and northeast. The highland area receives more rainfall than other parts of the state. <br>

                          <h1 class="card-heading">Agriculture</h1>
                          Agriculture is the main occupation of the people. Nearly half of the population depend upon agriculture for their livelihood. A unique feature of the State is the predominance of cash crops. Kerala is a major producer of coconut, rubber, pepper, cardamom, ginger, cocoa, cashew, arecanut, coffee and tea. Spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, etc., are also cultivated. Coconut is the most important cash crop of Kerala. Pepper earns the maximum foreign exchange. Banana, pineapple, mango and jackfruit are major fruit crops. Rice and tapioca are important food crops. Tapioca is generally consumed locally but some of it goes to feed the starch factories and mills manufacturing tapioca flour. Kerala is not self-sufficient in food. The total area under cultivation has increased in respect of coconut, rubber, pepper and turmeric. However, crops like cashewnut, banana, groundnut and sesamum have lost their coverage in area.<br>

                          <h1 class="card-heading">Industry</h1>
                          The state has a very good industrial potential because of good infrastructural facilities like hydro-power, transport system and availability of forest-based and mine-based rare minerals. Traditional industries are handloom, cashew, coir and handicrafts. Other important industries are rubber, tea, ceramics, electric and electronic appliances, telephone cables, transformers, bricks and tiles, drugs and chemicals, general engineering, plywood splints and veneers, Beedi and cigar, soaps, oils, fertilizers and Khadi and village industry products. A number of manufacturing units have also sprung-up for production of precision instruments, machine tools, petroleum and petroleum products, paints, pulp paper, newsprint, glass and non-ferrous metals. Principal export products are cashewnut, tea, coffee, spices, lemongrass oil, sea foods, rose wood and coir.<br>

                          <h1 class="card-heading">Mines & Minerals</h1>
                          The State has an abundance of important minerals like ilmenite, rutile, monazite, zircon, sillimanite, clay and quartz sand.

                          <h1 class="card-heading">Tourism</h1>
                          Kerala is an important tourist destination: attractive wildlife sanctuaries at Thekkady on the banks of river Periyar, at Parambikulam in Palakkad district and at Mananthavady, Sulthan Batheri and at Wayanad, seaside resort at Kovalam. Padmanabhaswami temple in Thiruvananthapuram is an exquisite specimen of South Indian architecture. Sabarimala temple of Lord Ayyappa is a famous pilgrim tourist centre in Pathanamthitta district.

                            surrounded by snow-capped mountains in Srinagar, offers mesmerizing houseboat experiences. Gulmarg's lush meadows

                            <h1 class="card-heading">History</h1>

                            There are many legends on Kashmir. According to Hindu mythology, Kashmir was created by Kashyap Rishi (Nilmat Purana & Rajtarangini). Emperor Ashok ruled this state in 3rd century B.C. and introduced Buddhism in this valley. Later Kushan king Kanishka ruled this state. In the 6th century Kashmir came under the control of Huns and regained freedom in 530 AD. Thereafter Gupta dynasty ruled this state until the period of Vikramaditya. After the decline of Vikramaditya, Lalitaditya ruled this state in 697-738 A.D. He was a famous builder. Muslims came to this area during 13th century A.D. Famous Muslim ruler Zain-ul-Abedin was a noted patron of music and dance. He ruled this state in 1420-70 and his successor ruled till 1586. Kashmir passed into the hands of Mughals in the period of Akbar. Mughal rulers were strong in this region prior to 1752, when Afgan ruler Ahmed-Shah Abdali took control of this state. Within a month of partition of India into India and Pakistan in August 1947 Pakistan sent the raiders, later to be identified as Pakistan's own troops, into Kashmir valley. But after October 24 1947 Kashmir valley's accession to India, the Indian army went into action. The Indian army pushed back the raiders until the UN-enforced cease fire stopped fighting on January 1, 1949 when two-thirds of the state was cleared of the invaders.
                            The history of Jammu is quite old. It finds a mention in the epic Mahabharata. This region was ruled by Dogra rulers. Raja Maldev and Raja Ranjit Dev are the famous Dogra rulers. After Raja Ranjit Dev the Jammu's Dogra regime became weak and Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab took over the state. Ranjit Singh handed over this state to one of his strongest governors and a scion of Dogra ruling family. His successors ruled the state till 1947. The Dogra King Hari Singh merged the state with the Indian Union.<br>

                            Varanasi, the spiritual heart of India, is adorned with captivating places of beauty. The ghats along 
                            the sacred Ganges River, such as Dashashwamedh Ghat and Manikarnika Ghat, offer mesmerizing views and 
                            spiritual experiences. The ancient temples like Kashi Vishwanath and Sankat Mochan are architectural marvels, 
                            steeped in history and devotion. The vibrant chaos of Varanasi's narrow alleys and bustling markets adds a unique 
                            charm to this mystical city, making it a place of enduring allure.

                            <h1 class="card-heading">History</h1>

                            The history of this state is very old. It is the birthplace of Lord Rama and Krishna. It is recognised in the later Vedic age as Brahmarshi Desa or Madhya Desha. Many famous ancient sages like Bharadwaja, Gautam, Yagyavalkya, Vasistha, Vishwamitra, and Valmiki appear to have flourished in this state. Many ancient sacred books were also composed here.
                            In sixth century B.C. two new religions, Buddhism and Jainism were associated with this state. In Sarnath, Lord Buddha preached his first sermon and died at Kushinagar. At Sarnath the great emperor Ashoka built one of his beautiful monolithic polished pillars with the 'four lions' capital on it. The Indian nation chose the four lion symbol as state emblem. Several important dynasties ruled over this state in pre-Christ era like Maurayas, Guptas, Pusyabhuti etc. Several centres like Ayodhya, Prayag, Varanasi and Mathura became the reputed centres of learning. In the medieval period the great Hindu reformer Sri Sankaracharya established one of his Ashrams in Badrinath. The slave dynasty ruler Kutubuddin Aibak established the Muslim rule over here.The Muslim regime led to a new synthesis of Hindu and Muslim culture. At that time Ramananda and his Muslim disciple Kabir, Tulsidas, Soordas and many other intellectuals contributed to the growth of Hindi and other languages. In the Mughal regime, particularly from the period of Akbar, Agra became an important place. He built the Agra Fort and his grandson Shahjahan built the famous Tajmahal, a tribute to his beloved wife Mumtazmahal. Uttar Pradesh preserved its intellectual leadership even under the British administration. The British combined Agra and Oudh into one province and called it United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. The name was shortened into United Provinces in 1935. Finally, in 1950 the India Government renamed it as Uttar Pradesh.
